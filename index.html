    <h1 align="center">MihAddon v0.3</h1>
    <p>MihAddon is a <a href="https://sa-mp.mp/">San Andreas Multiplayer (SA:MP)</a> modification which aims to improve the experience during gameplay.</p>
    <p>It was made by Mihael, who after the blacklist of the popular modification "SAMP Addon" on a server he plays, decided to take matters into his own hands and make a copy with all of his faverouite features + some crashfixes.</p>
    <p>Current mods/fixes in MihAddon:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A BUNCH of crash fixes that plague SA:MP and GTA:SA</li>
        <li>Fastmap/Rapidmap</li>
        <li>A transparent background and not pausing in the escape menu</li>
        <li>Forcing the FPS to be unlimited and limiting it to 100FPS</li>
        <li>Fastloader - pretty much skips the SAMP Splash screen, making it faster to login.</li>
        <li>nocamfreeze - a mod that doesn't freeze your camera if the server does - same thing SAMP Addon had (UNTESTED)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>JustMike (the creator) plans to make a bunch more fixes and modifications as time goes on.</p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>MihAddon was only tested on modloader, so do the following: extract the 3 files, and put all 3 of them into modloader.</p>
    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <p>Two mods (limitfps100.asi and blurthatshit.asi) are not made by JustMike, they are 3rd party mods that he was too lazy to make himself</p>
